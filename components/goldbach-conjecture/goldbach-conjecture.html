<h1 class="curiosity-title">The Goldbach Conjecture</h1>
<div>
  Any even number can be expressed as the sum of two primes. We define this
  pair of primes as the <b>Goldbach Factors</b>. Test it out yourself!

  It's interesting to note that the Goldbach conjecture implies the
  existence of a function $f$ that maps a pair of primes $(p,q)$ to an even
  number $n$. However, such a function cannot be a one-to-one mapping.

  Take for example the number 14. There are two pairs of primes such that
  their sum is equal to 14:
  $$
  (3,11): 3 + 11 = 14 \\
  (7,7): 7 + 7 = 14
  $$
  This implies that $f(3,11) = f(7,7) = 14$.
</div>

  In math, we call a one-to-one mapping a bijective function, or just a
  bijection. We care about bijections because their inverses map to
  exactly one element. However, in our case there is no straightforward
  way of inverting $f$. Every even number must have at least one prime
  pair solutions. Such a function is said to be surjective.

  Note about the Goldbach Factorizer above:
  <br><br>
  The way it works is by searching through a large primes file (10,000,000 primes).
  Many even numbers have a very small prime number as one of their prime factors,
  which is why in the common case the server performs the factorization
  quickly. However, at some point the search takes a few minutes to compute since
  the largest prime in the file is under 16,000,000. For example, factoring
  30,000,000 will still work, but take 5-10 minutes.
  <br><br>
  The prime number file was generated using a Fortran program that implements
  the sieve of Eratosthenes. The upper bound for generating 10,000,000 primes
  in the sieve was approximated using the Prime Number Theorem, which was then
  solved for using Newton's Method. The code can be seen
  <a href="https://github.com/ispashayev/algorithms/blob/master/lib/sieve-of-eratosthones.f03">here</a>.
