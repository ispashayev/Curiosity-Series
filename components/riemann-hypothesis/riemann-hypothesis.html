<h1 class=curiosity-title>The Riemann Hypothesis</h1>
<div>
  We will first define The Riemann zeta function and then dissect and
  interpret it.

  The definition is as follows:
  $$
  \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s} = \frac{1}{1^s} + \frac{1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} + \cdots
  $$

  The variable $s$ is over the domain of all Complex Numbers that have a real
  number component greater than 1. As a reminder to some readers, a complex
  number is a number that can be represented as $a + b \cdot i$, where
  $ i := \sqrt{-1} $, and $a$ and $b$ are both real numbers. $a$ is called the
  real component and $b$ is called the imaginary component. Even though these
  kinds of numbers are also called imaginary numbers, they are incredibly
  useful in many engineering and scientific applications, such as signal
  processing, fluid dynamics, and quantum mechanics to name just a few.

  Anyways, the Riemann Hypothesis states that the Riemann zeta function has its
  zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with real part
  $\frac{1}{2}$.
